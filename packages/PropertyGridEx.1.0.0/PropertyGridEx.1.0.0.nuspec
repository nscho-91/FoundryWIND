    <description>For my last project, I looked at the PropertyGrid control that has a very nice look and feel. Immediately, I noticed how difficult it was to use it. Looking over the Internet, I found lots of people wishing for something easier to use, like the TreeView or the ListView. So I started developing an extended version of the PropertyGrid that includes an Item collection.</description>
    <summary>Extend a PropertyGrid with an Item collection; easy customization of properties with custom editor, custom converter and databinding.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>I did not create this control, I packaged it up for NuGet because it is awsome. Here are the sources: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/13630/Add-Custom-Properties-to-a-PropertyGrid</releaseNotes>
